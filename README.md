blahg
=====

Blahg is a minimal one-column WordPress theme designed for readability and minimal distraction. It uses jQuery to hide unnecessary post meta info on index pages and the site header on post pages until it’s desired (found by hovering over the area.)

It’s an ideal theme for bloggers and writers who want to focus on their content without a lot of visual clutter.
